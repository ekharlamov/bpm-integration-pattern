	     <p>
	    	After generating the BPM Integration Service pattern instance, complete the following steps:</p> 
     	<ol>
     	<li>Implement the service operation by using a message flow. 
     	<p>For information about developing message flows, 
     	see <a class="xref" href="../../com.ibm.etools.mft.doc/bi12005_.htm" title="Developing message flows">Developing Message Flows</a>.</p></li>
     	<li>Add the service to a broker archive file (BAR).
     	    <ol>
     	       <li>Click <span class="uicontrol">File > New > BAR file</span>. </li>
     	       <li>Enter the name of your service or select one from the displayed list. 
     	       The list is filtered to show only projects in the active working set. </li>
     	       <li>Enter a name for the BAR file that you are creating. </li>
     	       <li>Click <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span>. A file with a <span class="filepath">.bar</span> extension 
     	       is created and is displayed in the Navigator view, under the Broker Archives folder. The Content Editor for 
     	       the BAR file opens. </li>
     	       <li>On the Prepare tab, select the generated service to add to your BAR file.</li>
     	       <li>Click <span class="uicontrol">Build and Save</span> to create your BAR file.</li> 
     	       </ol>
     	</li>
     	<li><b>Optional:</b> Configure the BAR file you have created. You are not required to configure the message flow in 
     	    the BAR file before you deploy the message flows for your BPM Integration Service pattern 
     	    instance. Later, you might want to change some of the default options depending on your environment. </li>
     	<li>Deploy the BAR file to an integration server (execution group).</li>
     	<li>In the Application Development navigator, right-click on <span class="uicontrol">Integration Service Description</span> 
     	in your service and click <span class="uicontrol">Export Integration Service > IBM Business Process Manager</span>. 
     	The Select Deployed Service window opens.</li>
     	<li>You can change the host name or listener port for the service, or accept the defaults, 
     	and click <span class="uicontrol">Next</span>. The Export IBM Business Process Manager Snapshot window opens.</li>
     	<li>Enter a name and file path for the new snapshot and click <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span>. The snapshot is saved 
     	as a new <span class="filepath">.twx</span> file.</li>
     	<li>Using the BPM toolkit that was used to create the BPM integration service, import the 
     	new <span class="filepath">.twx</span> file.The BPM integration service is updated with the 
     	details of the IBM Integration Bus service.</li>
     	<p>The BPM integration service can now call the IBM Integration Bus service.</p>
